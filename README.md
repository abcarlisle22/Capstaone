How Prostate Cancer compares to all Cancers
Using all Cancer data from Census and CDC starting 1999 to 2017. I intend to explore the data and analyze the distribution of cancers incidence rates and mortality rates across the states. Compare how Prostate cancer ranks between Ethnicities, within Age-groups, and Geographically.  Prostate Cancer is an increasing concern for many American men today. Prostate cancer occurs when male glands that produces fluid that forms part of semen develops cancer cells and go out of control- and crowd out healthy cells making it difficult for the body function normally.  Prostate cancer is the second largest cause of cancer death. Risk factors include-increasing old age and family history. History has shown that there are health disparities among different ethnic populations- the objective of this project is to look at different data to uncover underlying reasons as to why- also with the analysis from this project to help inform the public, government agency and other organizations better allocate resources in prevention, screening and treatment. 

Motivation
Being a person of color- the prevalence of Prostate cancer among men African decent- statistics have shown staggering numbers over the years an increase of prevalence among African American men- my goal is to discover from the data the incidences rates vs mortality rates to see if there are any particular correlations that stand out compared to other races- I intend to look at data and research from Medicare and Medicaid, Census to evaluate whether early screening has any variance as to the rate survival.

Data Question-
Look at prevalence of all cancers percentage rates vs prostate cancer by region, state, age_group, and ethnicity.
